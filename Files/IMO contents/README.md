  These are notes/problem sheets to some of my talks in AOPS, IYSC,... 
  The notes are mostly in Persian/Farsi and almost all of them are publicly available for free. I try to give a short discreption of each note in here:

  #### Iran Summer Camp 2021 Number Theory Problem Sheets
  During my experience as the head of number theory team in Iran summer camp (training participants for the third round) I, along with the other heads and tutors, made a problem set of 8 topics of number theory that are taught in the summer camp. Almost all of these problems are chosen from mathematical olympiads and books. The topics go on from the Fermat's little theorem and Euler totient function all the way to primitive roots, PÃ³lya-Vinogradov Inequality and Dirichlet characters, some of which are not included in the syllabus but taught as extra contents. All of the problem sets also have a hint/solution set for the aforementioned problems. I also did give one of the number theory lectures of the summer camp, which went on about the quadratic reciprocity and some of its proofs and consequences, along with solving some problems on this topic.
  
  #### M2Q, M3Q booklet
  A series of exams/problem sheets similar to 2nd/3rd rounds of Iran mathematical olympiad. Each booklet contains several exams (for a duration of 4.5 hours, as in IMO) and contains problems (either by my own or from other countries mathematical olympiads) and full solutions to the problems (mostly by ourselves).
  
  #### CRT Babaeii
  A thorough introduction to the chinese remainder theorem (CRT) in $\mathbb{Z}$ and its applications/techniques towards some famous problems from several countries' mathematical olympiads. Some exercise problems are left for the reader in the end of the note.

  #### Vp Babaeii
  The first section of this note is a thorough introduction to the $p$-adic valuation and some of its basic properties. The second part, however, is dedicated to lifting the exponents (LTE) lemma -one of the most interesting theorems of elementary number theory in my opinion- along with its proof and some applications/techniques towards some famous problems from several countries' mathematical olympiads. Some exercise problems are left for the reader in the end of the note.

  #### RUF
  These are some not-so-well-organized course notes for one of my lectures for the Iran IMO team. The note goes about the technique called roots of unity filter, which is in essence a vast generalization to the Vieta formulae for polynomials, giving the symmetric sums (including the sum and product) of roots of a polynomial in terms of its coefficients.

  #### T2 AND BEYOND
  This is a course note for another one of my lectures for the Iran IMO team. The note starts off with one of the most well-known inequalities of $\mathbb{R}$ in mathematical olympliad -termed as the Titu inequality- which simply states that for given $a_1,\dotsb,a_n\in\mathbb{R}$ and $b_1,\dotsb,b_n\in\mathbb{R}^+$, the following holds: $\sum\frac{{a_i}^2}{b_i}\ge\frac{(\sum a_i)^2}{\sum b_i}$ (note that this is basically a deformed Cauchy-Schwarz inequality). Then the note goes on to generalize this inequality to a far less known inequality of Radon (far more powerful that Titu or Cauchy-Schwarz) and goes on to prove and solve some difficult olympiad problems with it.
